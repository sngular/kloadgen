### Arrays and maps

The `array` and `map` types are shown as `*-array` and `*-map`, respectively, in the column **Field Type**. See each field on detail in the next table. 

**Notes for array fields**:
 - Arrays appear in the **Field Name** column with **[]** at the end of the field name (i.e. metadata.extensions.flows[].correlation[]).
 - The sample data for array fields will be generated using the data included in **Field Values List** as a comma separated value list.
 
**Notes for map fields**:
 - Maps appear in the **Field Name** colum with **[:]** at the end of the field name (i.e. metadata.extensions.flows[].correlation[:]).
 - The sample data for map fields will be generated using the data included in **Field Values List** as a comma separated value list. These values can be sets of pairs _key:value_ (key1:value, key2:value, key3:value) or just as a set of keys ((key1,key2,key3). In this last case, the values will be randomly generated following the applicable constraints.

## Special field types

### Arrays and maps combined

You can also have these special types:

- An array of maps, **( * )-map-array**, following this pattern: ArrayOfMaps[ArraySize][MapSize:].
- A map of arrays, **( * )-array-map**, following this pattern: MapOfArrays[MapSize:][ArraySize].

> Pay attention to the colon. Arrays do not have colon, maps do. The size for maps is set to the left of the colon ([8:]). 

### Sequences

A special type has also been created, `seq`, to allow creating a custom sequence of values. 

In order to create a sequence, you need to specify `seq` as **Field Type**.

> In previous versions (up to 4.0.0), typing `{` in **Field Values List** was another requirement in order to create sequences. This is no longer required or supported.

| Type | Details                                                             |  Returns |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| seq | Generates a numeric sequence starting in 1. Will cast to the AVRO Field Type. | Returns a sequence starting in 1 |

**Note:** If you want to specify a starting value, put it in the **Field Values List** field.

> Sequences don't accept more than one value in the **Field Values List** field.

> Keep in mind to avoid Cast exceptions.

This screenshot shows an example of how KLoadGen generates sequences:

![Sequence generator](images/sequence-generator.png)

The field name will be generated as sequences from 1 to 5.

### Iterators

It has also been created a new type of field, `it`, to allow creating a custom iterator of values.

In order to create an iterator, you need to specify `it` as **Field Type**.

| Type | Details                                                                                                             | Returns                                   |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| it   | Generates and iteration of values. It will return `null` if it doesn't find a value in the **Field Values List** field. | Returns an iteration of the given values. |

### Date and Time types

Every kind of schema manage date and time types in a different way when they are passed as constant values from Jmeter, at the moment of random values generation:
- Avro has its own dates system, so it's no necessary implement anything.
- In Json, these types are implemented as a String with a specific format properly defined by KLoadGen.
- For Protobuf definition, KLoadGen only supports `Date` and `TimeOfDay`. The rest of types are in development.
  - If specific values wants to be passed from Jmeter they must be strings compatibles with `ISO_LOCAL_DATE` for Date and `ISO_LOCAL_TIME` or `ISO_OFFSET_TIME` for TimeOfDay.
  - If the offset is indicated (for example 10:20:30-04:00), the value of return will have the amount of time subtracted or added it. Otherwise, the offset value will be established by default according to local zone.

## Null values

KLoadGen supports the use of `null` values in **Field Values List** for any optional field defined in a schema.

This applies to any field defined as `"type": ["null", AnyType]` in an AVRO schema or as `optional` in a PROTOBUF schema, or to any field not included in the `required` array in a JSON Schema structure, that **has `null` included** in the corresponding **Field Values List**.

This feature works with simple fields, such as `string`, and also with further complex structures, such as a `string` field inside a `record` field.

There are, though, **two exceptions**.

### Complex objects with optional children

If you have a complex object —such as a map, array or record— defined as **required** and **all of its children fields are optional**, there could be a conflict if all these children fields receive `null` in their FieldValueList. Since an object with all of its fields set to `null` is equivalent to a null object, the **required** status of the parent object will be violated.

In case this situation happens, the last child of the object will be generated as it would not have received `null` in FieldValueList.

Let's see an example of this:

```
O1-Not Required{
    C1-Not Required,
    C2-Not Required
}
```

In the example above, both the children fields 'C1' and 'C2' receive `null` in their FieldValuesList. Therefore, the result will be `O1: null`, because none of the involved fields is required.

```
O2-Required{
    C3-Not Required
    C4-Not Required
}
```

Here, both the children fields 'C3' and 'C4' receive `null` in their FieldValueList, **violating the required status** of 'O2'. In this case, the **last child will be forcely generated** as if it didn't receive `null`. Therefore, the final result will be `O2: {C3: null, C4: ramdonValue}`.

```
O3-Required{
    C5-Not Required
    O4-Not Required{
        C6-Not Required
        C7-Not Required
    }
}
```

The same applies when there is more than one level. The last child in the last level will be forcely generated as a random value in order to avoid the violation of the main object. In this case, `C7` is the value that gets changed. Therefore, the final result will be `O3: {C5: null, O4: {C6: null, C7: ramdonValue}}` ('04' automatically changes as per the change in 'C7').

### JSON Schema

The other exception applies to JSON Schema: in order to support `null`values, the collections within objects (type : object) cannot be null. Therefore, they will be **required by default** and they will be **initialized as an empty collection** if the object than contains them is not null.

> Within JSON Schema, a maximum of **2 nesting levels** is allowed.
